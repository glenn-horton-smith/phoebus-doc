Window Environment
==================

When you start Phoebus for the first time, it opens in a main window.

As you use the *Applications* menu to open for example Probe, the PV Tree etc.,
these all open up as new Tabs.

The behavior of these tabs is very similar to the handling of tabs
in modern web browsers.
You can rearrange the tabs within a window by dragging them around.
In addition, you can drag a tab out of the window to detach it as its own window.
Tabs can be dragged between the main window and such detached windows.

By default, even a window with just one tab will show that tab.
This has the advantage that you can then grab that tab to move it
into another window.
At times, however, you may prefer to hide such singular tabs
to preserve screen space.
In the *Window* menu, select *Always show Tabs* to show respectively hide
singular tabs.
